# Quadsat Frontend Developer Recruitment Task

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Task A: Approach to Transformation
# Technology Stack

This project was developed using a modern and efficient technology stack to ensure a robust and scalable frontend:

- React.js: As the core frontend library for building dynamic and interactive user interfaces.
- Tailwind CSS: Employed for styling, allowing for a responsive and clean design without the need for custom CSS.
- React ApexCharts: Integrated for rendering interactive and visually appealing charts in line with the provided design.

# General Approach

Project Structure

The project follows a well-organized structure for maintainability and scalability:

- **src/assets/:** Contains static assets such as images, icons, and SVGs.
- **src/components/:** Holds reusable UI components, promoting code reusability and separation of concerns.
- **src/data/:** Includes the Data JSON Structure that allows for easy integration with the dynamic chart components.
- **src/pages/:** Contains page-level components. In this Web Application Prototype, "Missions" page was the one developed and set to Active.
- **src/styles/:** Leverages Tailwind CSS for styling, promoting a consistent design language.
- 
#### Components
The UI is divided into modular components, each responsible for a specific aspect of the application. Notable components include:

- **Sidebar:** Responsible for navigation and user interface toggling.
- **SidebarItem:** Represents individual items in the sidebar menu, ensuring clarity and responsiveness.
- **FlightPathChart2D and FlightPathChart3D:** Components dedicated to rendering 2D and 3D flight path charts using React ApexCharts.

#### Responsive Design
Tailwind CSS is utilized for responsive design, ensuring a seamless experience across various devices. Media queries and utility classes are employed for adaptability and flexibility in layout adjustments.

### Challenges
#### 3D Chart Implementation
The implementation of the 3D chart posed specific challenges that required additional time and consideration. 

#### Time Constraints
The task was initially estimated to take approximately 3 hours. However, due to the complexities involved, the development time exceeded the initial estimate. The commitment to delivering a high-quality solution and overcoming challenges took precedence over adhering strictly to the initial timeframe.

- I appreciate your understanding and am open to feedback and further discussions on optimizing and refining the 3D chart implementation.

### Comments and Documentation
The codebase includes extensive inline comments to clarify complex logic, major decisions, and features.
